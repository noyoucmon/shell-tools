Shell Tools
===========

Shell scripts that might come in quite handy. You can add the `bin` folder to your `PATH` for convenience.
```bash
export PATH="/path/to/noyoucmon/shell-tools/bin:$PATH"
```

## git-export
Exports the current repo into a ZIP file. `-b` defaults to `master`.

```bash
git export [-b BRANCH]
```
